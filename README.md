## DirectXHook + Overlay Framework
A DirectX hook that works with DirectX11 and DirectX12 in 32-bit and 64-bit. A straightforward but primitive overlay framework is included.

## How to create an overlay
First, check the [wiki page](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/wiki/How-to-set-up-the-Visual-Studio-solution) on how to quickly set up the Visual Studio solution.

When the project is built, "dxgi.dll" will be generated in the project folder. This can be copied next to a game executable which uses DirectX 11 or 12. The game will load the .dll automatically on startup and will render what you told it to.

Also note that the "hook_textures" folder containing "blank.jpg" must be present next to dxgi.dll in order for anything to render.

### Create files
Create a .cpp and .h file in the Overlays folder (optionally put these inside a parent folder):

![create_files](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/create_files.png)

Create a class that inherits from the IRenderCallback interface and includes "OverlayFramework.h":

![example_header](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/example_header.png)

Define the Setup() and Render() functions in the .cpp file:

![example_source](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/example_source.png)

**Note: Setup() is called once and Render() is called every frame. InitFramework() must be called on the very first line in Setup().**

Make the hook render your stuff by adding these lines in DllMain.cpp:

![dllmain](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/dllmain.png)

But we have yet to define anything to render...

### Boxes
All rendering with the overlay framework is done using Boxes:

![box_struct](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/box_struct.png)

Boxes are a simple struct with data that the framework manages.

- **pressed** = if the mouse is currently being pressed on this box
- **clicked** = if the mouse was previously pressed and then released on the box this frame
- **hover** = if the mouse is hovering over the box

The rest are self-explanatory. Do not modify **visible** or **z**.

Create some boxes and render them:

![rgb_boxes_code](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/rgb_boxes_code.png)

Result:

![rgb_boxes](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/rgb_boxes.png)

Boxes can be rendered with either textures or colors:

![textures_code](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/textures_code.png)

**Note: textures should be loaded in Setup().**

Result:

![textures](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/textures.png)

Text can be rendered inside Boxes:

![text_code](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/text_code.png)

**Note: a font must be set before rendering text.**

Result:

![text](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook/blob/master/assets/repo_pictures/text.png)
